Following a trend from Mike Stone on FOSStodon, I'm posting my latest desktop for posterity. The point of the point was to compare desktops from now vs 10-years ago. Unfortunately, I have no screenshot of my desktop from 10-years ago, so I will start the trend today. This is my current Fedora 35 Plasma desktop; we'll see whats happening in another 10-years.
