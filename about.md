Hey, my name is Tony Cavella and this is my personal blog. It serves no particular niche, but gives me a place to express myself and write about various topics. I cannot guarentee any regular schedule of updates, but will try to post semi-regularly.</p>

<p class="smedium">My day job keeps me busy primarily as a Linux System Engineer where I support multiple projects in the mobility sector. Prior to this I served honorably in the United States Army where I visited all kinds of exotic foreign lands like Aghanistan.</p>

## Homelab
I'm currently working on building what I consider the ultimate Raspberry Pi based homelab. Trying to stay current and relevant in the IT field is incredibly important and a homelab is key to this in my mind. The homelab allows you to practice and maintain your current skills, while giving you opportunties to try new things that you wouldn't always get a chance to do at work.

## This Site
This website is built with Jekyll, a static site generator. This is hosted for free using Github Pages. The design and css is based off of the [Simple.css ver. 2](https://simplecss.org) by [Key Quirk](https://kevq.uk/about). I do not claim to be a web developer, but have done a fair amount of work to customize and tweak the design to make it my own.
